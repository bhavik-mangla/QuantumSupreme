Digital Secure Vault and QuantumGuard Banking Simulation
Engineered an app for storing/sharing files, and passwords, while simulating banking transactions with Quantum Resistant Algos.
– Implemented Crystal’s Kyber algorithm for quantum-safe encryption of files, passwords, and banking transactions.
– Designed and built a user-friendly Flutter app and utilized Python (Flask) for server-side logic and API integration.
– Utilized SQLite for efficient storage, implemented SHA-256 for Proof of Work, AES for local data encryption.
– Created quantum-secure digital signatures for blockchain ledger technologies using ReactJS for frontend.
